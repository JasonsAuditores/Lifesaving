# Lifesaving for Surge User
This project is for those Apple Device Users, including Mac and iOS.

Using Surge as their internet management sytem

Recommand using Domain-set first, if no in Domain-set, then the Rule-set one.

I just listed some rules that I use for daily.

Tips: Click Surge - Proxy Rules - Add New.. - Add NEW Ruleset - External Ruleset and pick up one of my raw txt into it, choosing the proper proxy you want.

Normally, Surge on my device is using WireGuard as the protocol to back to my home router then Surf the internet.

Proxies verndor that I am using: https://www.easy2022.com/#/register?code=mmG4jL0R
