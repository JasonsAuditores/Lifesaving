Using Surge as their internet management sytem
I just list some rules that I use for daily.
Tips: Click Surge - Proxy Rules - Add New.. - Add NEW Ruleset - External Ruleset and pick up one of my raw txt into it, choosing the proper proxy you want.
Normally, Surge on my device is using WireGuard as the protocol to back to my home router than Surf the internet.
